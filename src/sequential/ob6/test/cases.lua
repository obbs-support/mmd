-- REQUIRED TEST DATA FILES:
--
-- This test suite uses test data in SysEx files that must be obtained 
-- (dumped) from an actual device:
--  - edit-buffer-dump.syx: dump of active program (as acquired by sending
--    the SysEx command in edit-buffer-dump-request.syx to the OB-6);
--  - program-N-dump.syx: dump of stored program #N (as acquired by sending
--    the SysEx command in program-N-dump-request.syx to the OB-6);
--  - globals-dump.syx: dump of the settings in SysEx format (as acquired 
--    by sending the SysEx command in globals-dump-request.syx to the 
--    OB-6);
--
-- "globals-dump.midi" is a sequence of MIDI CC messages that one would 
-- transmit to the OB-6 in order to restore the globals acquired via SysEx
-- dump. The OB-6 encapsulates and dumps its global parameters in a SysEx 
-- message when commanded, but does not handle this SysEx message. Instead 
-- the parameters must be restored individually via MIDI CC messages.
